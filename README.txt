Program 2--Function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns the sum of its digits.
Program 3--Function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns the sum of all the integers that are less than the given number.
Program 4--Function that takes a non-negative integer as a parameter and returns its factorial.
Program 5--Boolean function that takes two positive integers as parameters and figures out whether the second number is a factor of the first.
Program 6--Boolean function that takes an integer greater than or equal to 2 as a parameter and returns whether the number is a prime.
